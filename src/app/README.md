Explanations of Chloropred ,Qchloro, Mitopred,Qmito,Secrpred,Qsecr, and FinalPred.

- Chloropred
    - Prediction score indicating the likelihood of the protein being localized to the Chloroplast. A higher scores suggest a stronger prediction that the protein is localized in the Chloroplast.
- Qchloro
    - q-value associated with the Chloroplast prediction score. Provides a measure of statistical significance for the Chloroplast prediction. Lower q-values indicate higher statistical significance.
- Mitopred
    - Prediction score for the localization of the protein to the Mitochondria. A higher scores suggest a stronger prediction of Mitochondrial localization.
- Qmito
    -  q-value associated with the Mitochondria prediction score. Indicates the statistical significance of the Mitochondria localization prediction. Lower q-values suggest a more reliable prediction.
- Secrpred
    - Prediction score for identifying the protein as a Secretory Protein.A higher scores indicate a stronger likelihood that the protein functions as a Secretory Protein.
- Qsecr
    - q-value for the Secretory Protein prediction. Provides a measure of the statistical significance of the Secretory Protein prediction. Lower q-values are indicative of more statistically significant predictions.
- FinalPred
    - Represents the model's final prediction of the protein's localization based on the highest score and its corresponding q-value. The final localization is determined by comparing the q-values and prediction scores against preset cutoffs. If all q-values exceed the cutoff, the protein is classified as "Cytoplasmic."

- Cutoff
    - The threshold q-value below which a prediction is considered statistically significant. Set to 0.05 by default, meaning that predictions with q-values below this threshold are classified as significant. This parameter helps in distinguishing between statistically significant and non-significant predictions, reducing the chance of false-positive localizations.
